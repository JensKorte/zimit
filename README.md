Create ZIM files out of HTTP websites

# Previous version

A first version of a generic HTTP scraper was created in 2016 during the [Wikimania Esino Lario Hackathon](https://wikimania2016.wikimedia.org/wiki/Programme/Kiwix-dedicated_Hackathon).

That version is now considered outdated and [archived in `2016` branch](https://github.com/openzim/zimit/tree/2016).
